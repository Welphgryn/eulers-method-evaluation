<h1>Euler's Method in Perl</h1>

<p>This repository contains a basic implementation of the Euler's method for finding the approximate value of a differential equation's solution at a given point, written in Perl. Um, it's Welphgryn approved, but I had some issues when I revisted in 2023.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>These instructions will get you a copy of the code up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You will need Perl installed on your machine. You can download it from the <a href="https://www.perl.org/get.html">official website</a>.</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p>To get the code, simply clone the repository:</p>

<pre>
<code>git clone https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/eulers-method-perl.git</code>
</pre>

<p>Replace &lt;username&gt; with your GitHub username.</p>

<h2>Running the Code</h2>

<p>To run the code, navigate to the repository's directory and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
<code>perl eulers_method.pl</code>
</pre>

<p>This will run the code and print the final value of <code>y</code> at the end value of <code>x</code> specified in the code.</p>

<h2>Customizing the Code</h2>

<p>You can modify the code to suit your needs by changing the function <code>f</code> to calculate the derivative of your desired differential equation, the initial values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, the step size <code>h</code>, and the end value of <code>x</code>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This code serves as a basic implementation of the Euler's method in Perl. It can be a starting point for more complex implementations or for understanding how the method works.</p>
